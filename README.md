# Homebridge MiIO Local Platform Plugin

>  ATTENTION: This is a newly created project and only support few of the MiIO Devicesï¼ˆcause I don't have other devices). Please be careful to use.

This is a homebridge platform plugin that bridges your MiIO devices to HomeKit with MiIO protocol only. MiIO is a protocol running in local network, so you don't need to provide your online account and credentials.
